Rajya Vardhan Mishra, I am an Engineering Manager working at Google with almost 20 years of experience. If I could sit down with a Jr. Software Engineer, here are 50 cheat codes I would share with them that I learned from my experiences. 

[1] Ask why this system even needs to exist
➤ Before a single line is written, challenge the core purpose, “Is this a business problem or just a tech exercise?” Real systems solve pain, not boredom.

[2] Redraw the lines, define what’s “inside” and “outside” your system
➤ Figure out where your service starts, stops, and how it talks to the world. 80% of future headaches come from blurred boundaries.

[3] Don’t chase new tech for the resume, use what your org supports
➤ That AWS Lambda demo looks cool until your team tells you there’s a 10-year-old Jenkins server already scheduled to do that job. Proven > Shiny.

[4] System design isn’t “one size fits all”, context is everything
➤ YouTube and interview videos show perfect worlds. Your system will live in mess, legacy, and compromise. Embrace it.

[5] Optimize for “how easy to change?” not “how cool is this?”
➤ You won’t get it perfect first time. Make it so anyone (even you) can swap out parts later, with minimal pain.

[6] Start with use cases, not tech
➤ Interview solutions start with “put Kafka here.” Real solutions start with “who will use this and how?”

[7] Know your real users, not just your APIs
➤ Customers, PMs, even other devs, all are “users” with needs. If your “system” forgets one, it’s doomed.

[8] Design for the traffic you have, not the traffic you dream of
➤ Every engineer who overbuilt for ‘Google scale’ at a 10K user startup has regretted it. Scale when you must.

[9] Understand your company’s default tech stack, don’t fight it
➤ Don’t propose a NoSQL database if everyone else is running Postgres unless you have a bulletproof case.

[10] Pick the boring solution if you want peace
➤ Every time I chased “the best tech,” maintenance bit me back. The system you forget about is the most stable one.

[11] Get the team’s buy-in before you architect a “masterpiece”
➤ Don’t be a solo hero. Feedback from PMs, ops, QA, other engineers, all of it will expose what you missed.

[12] Refactor and cleanup aren’t “nice to haves”, they’re your real job
➤ Every shortcut you leave will double your pain in 6 months.

[13] Read logs and production metrics every week
➤ Production is where truth lives. Ignore at your own risk.

[14] Test how things break, not just how they work
➤ Simulate failing databases, crashing services, weird user flows, assume chaos is coming.

[15] You’ll be asked to fix code you didn’t write, embrace it
➤ Legacy code is half your career. Treat it with respect and curiosity, not blame.

[16] Never let a diagram go out without clear boundaries
➤ Always show what’s external, what’s internal, and what’s a dependency, otherwise, no one will know what breaks what.

[17] Resist the urge to build microservices too early
➤ Monoliths are easier to deploy, debug, and reason about at small scale. Split later, when pain justifies it.

[18] Cost matters. Everything costs.
➤ Tech choices drive real AWS bills, real SRE time, and real business dollars. You’re not in a vacuum.

[19] Learn the difference between “urgent” and “important”
➤ Shipping is important. Most “emergencies” are just poor planning. Hold your ground and focus.

[20] Use peer reviews to teach and learn, not just to catch bugs
➤ Explain the “why” of your changes, don’t just fix syntax. That’s how teams level up together.

[21] Don’t let “learning opportunity” override “business need”
➤ The podcast story: Picking AWS Lambda for fun, when Jenkins was enough, burned weeks and money. Be practical, not aspirational.

[22] Fight for simplicity, even if it’s not sexy
➤ Over-architected “best practices” will turn into tech debt you’ll own for years.

[23] Read company principles, they exist for a reason
➤ “Do no evil,” “Customer obsession”, whatever it is, your designs need to serve them.

[24] Trace every feature to a real business metric
➤ Can you map your new code to higher revenue, happier customers, or lower cost? If not, question why you’re building it.

[25] When in doubt, ask questions, never fake confidence
➤ Even the best engineers are relentless question-askers. No shame in clarity.

[26] Don’t build “future-proof” abstractions for problems you don’t have
➤ Design for today’s needs with just enough flexibility, but don’t gold-plate. YAGNI is real.

[27] Don’t try to “outsmart” your future teammates
➤ Clever hacks are cool till nobody understands your trick six months later. Prioritize clear over clever.

[28] Surface assumptions, write them down
➤ What do you expect to be true? What are you betting on? Make it visible so everyone is aligned.

[29] Prototype to cut through uncertainty
➤ If you’re stuck, build a small proof of concept before committing weeks to the “main” design.

[30] Default to “fail safe,” not “fail loud”
➤ Design so things degrade gracefully, users shouldn’t see stack traces or ugly errors unless it’s unavoidable.

[38] Your value isn’t lines of code, it’s problems solved
➤ Ten lines that unlock a business win beat 1,000 lines of “busy work.”

[39] Never let ambiguity paralyze you
➤ If requirements are fuzzy, get what you can, build a thin slice, and iterate. Movement > perfection.

[40] The best engineers are calm in chaos
➤ You’ll see outages, bugs, angry customers, don’t panic, just start troubleshooting step by step.

[41] Influence is about trust, not just skills
➤ Speak with honesty, deliver consistently, own your mistakes, teams follow who they trust.

[42] Every major decision: write a one-pager and get input
➤ Don’t launch a big refactor or design change solo, collect wisdom, spot blind spots, then move.

[43] Don’t become “the only person who knows X”
➤ Share knowledge, document quirks, and onboard others, being a bottleneck will hurt you and the team.

[44] Use business constraints as design constraints
➤ Timeline, budget, hiring, partnerships, these are as real as CPU and RAM. Design for the world you have.

[45] Cut scope before you cut quality
➤ Ship a small, solid feature now, not a giant, half-baked one later.

[46] Make rollback and recovery easy from day one
➤ Assume your first launch will break. Plan your escape hatch and test it.

[47] Mentor, don’t micromanage
➤ Ask questions, suggest approaches, but let juniors struggle and learn. The best growth comes with ownership.

[48] Design for maintenance, not just “go live”
➤ Will this be easy to update, debug, and extend six months from now? If not, you’ll regret it.

[49] Don’t “gatekeep”, bring others up
➤ Celebrate other people’s wins, teach them the “why” behind your decisions.
That’s how you build a real engineering culture.

[50] The journey is the lesson, collect habits, not certificates
➤ Great engineers aren’t built in bootcamps or via one interview. It’s consistency, humility, and learning from each battle.
